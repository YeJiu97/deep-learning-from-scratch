    "In the competitive aerospace manufacturing industry, efficiency and cost management are pivotal to maintaining profitability and sustaining business growth. This report addresses the operational challenge faced by a fully automated factory tasked with producing rocket engines. Each engine requires a precise composition of parts: one unit of part A, two units of part B, and four units of part C. The costs associated with these parts are `$20`, `$15`, and `$10` respectively, and the final product is sold for `$300`.\n",

This allocation allows Machine 1 to contribute significantly despite its slower production rates for Parts A and B.\n",
